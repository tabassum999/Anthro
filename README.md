# Anthropoid - A SEMI HUMANOID FACE RECOGNITION ROBOT

# OBJECTIVE:
To design a humanoid with human-like recognition especially with artificial intelligence algorithms that could be useful to man and serve as an assistant. Till date, humanoid robots have been majorly used for research purpose.


# MECHANICAL DESIGN

# CHASSIS
A chassis is the base of the robot, consisting of the frame on which the body is mounted. For this humanoid, we use a Three Wheel Design.

# 3 WHEEL DESIGN
A three wheel design offers greater traction as any reactive force is distributed through only three points and the robot is well balanced even on uneven terrain. This design also reduces an additional wheel compared to a 4 wheeled robot which makes it cost effective.  Our design is a Three Wheeled Omni Robot i.e. two wheels parallel to each other and one wheel perpendicular to the two wheels.

# METAL GEARBOX MOTORS
Metal Gearbox Motor is suitable for bigger robots. It has sturdy construction with large gears. Gear box is built to handle the stall torque produced by the motor. Drive shaft is supported from both sides with metal bushes. Motor runs smoothly at 12V and gives 4 RPM at full load.

# Specifications:
- Voltage	12v
- No load speed	5rpm
- Rated speed	4rpm
- Rated torque	60kg.cm
- Stall torque	152kg.cm
- Continuous current	1.42A


# Planetory Gear Box High torque 100kg DC Motor:
# Specifications:
- Modulation	Analog
- Torque	190 kg.cm
- Speed	No Load: 8 rpm
- Full Road: 6 rpm
- Dimensions	Length: 42 mm
- Diameter	12 mm


# SERVO MOTORS:
A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.
# Specifications:
- Modulation	Analog
- Torque	4.8v:3.17kg.cm
- 6.0v:4.10kg.cm
- Speed	4.8v:0.23sec/60degree
- 6.0v:0.19sec/60degree
- Weight	1.31 oz(37.0g)
- Dimensions	Length:1,57in
- Width:0.79in
- Height:1.42in
- Rotational Range	60degree
- Pulse cycle	30ms
- Pulse width	500-3000µs

# UPPER BODY
The upper body consists of the head, torso and limbs. The torso and the arms (excluding the wrist and further) are to be fabricated using aluminum. The head and palms are to be 3D printed.
The arm consists of three Mega Torque motors with six degrees of freedom. A motor is placed at each of the joints - shoulder, elbow and wrist respectively.
  

# RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL B
Now with a Quad-Core 64bit CPU, WiFi& Bluetooth! The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the third generation Raspberry Pi. This powerful credit-card sized single board computer can be used for many applications and supersedes the original Raspberry Pi Model B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. This latest model includes 802.11nWiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and a quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A53 running at 1.2 GHz.

# ARDUINO
Micro-Controller Board used for the project is Arduino Mega ADK. The Arduino ADK is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560 (datasheet). It has a USB host interface to connect with Android based phones, based on the MAX3421e IC.It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, 
a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.

# PS2 CONTROLLER
The PS2 wireless controller is a standard controller for the playStation2 and is identical to the original DualShock controller for the play station console. It features twelve analog(pressure-sensitive) buttons, five digital buttons and twoanalog sticks. 
RASPBERRY PI CAMERA BOARD V2 – 8MEGAPIXEL
The Raspberry Pi Camera Board v2 is a high quality 8 megapixel Sony IMX219 image sensor custom designed add-on board for Raspberry Pi, featuring a fixed focus lens. It's capable of 3280 x 2464 pixel static images, and also supports 1080p30, 720p60, and 640x480p90 video.
It attaches to the Pi by way of one of the small sockets on the board's upper surface and uses the dedicated CSi interface, designed especially for interfacing to cameras.

# 7” TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY
The 7” Touchscreen Monitor for Raspberry Pi gives users the ability to create all-in-one, integrated projects such as tablets, infotainment systems and embedded projects. The 800 x 480 display connects via an adapter board which handles power and signal conversion. Only two connections to the Pi are required; power from the Pi’s GPIO port and a ribbon cable that connects to the DSI port present on all Raspberry Pi’s.  Touchscreen drivers with support for 10-finger touch and an on-screen keyboard will be integrated into the latest Raspbian OS for full functionality without the need for a physical keyboard or mouse.
